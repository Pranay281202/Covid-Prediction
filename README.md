# Covid-Prediction

The project entails various procedural stages, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model construction, evaluation, and model selection.

Throughout this endeavor, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest algorithms underwent scrutiny for their effectiveness. Notably, the random forest algorithm emerged as the most adept, boasting the highest accuracy, superior recall values, and the lowest Type 2 error rate.

To elaborate, the random forest algorithm achieved a recall rate of 0.85 for class 0 (signifying accurate identification of COVID-19 cases) and a recall rate of 0.72 for class 1 (indicating precise identification of non-COVID cases), resulting in an overall accuracy of 78%. Such outcomes underscore the algorithm's proficiency in reliably predicting COVID-19 status, underscoring its potential utility in clinical contexts.
